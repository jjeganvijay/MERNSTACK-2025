            <strong>Q: What do the ellipses (...) in if...else and do...while represent?</strong>

            <strong>Q: Why does a 'for...in' loop show undefined when accessing an object's property using the dot operator?</strong>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> This occurs because the dot operator looks for a property literally named "key," rather than dynamically accessing the value stored in the key variable.</p>
