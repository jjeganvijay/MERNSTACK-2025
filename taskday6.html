    <h1>Why Components Start with Capital Letters</h1>
    <p>
        In JavaScript frameworks like React, it's a best practice to use uppercase letters for naming components. This practice ensures that components are easily distinguishable from standard HTML tags.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <strong>Component Naming Rules:</strong> When working with JSX (JavaScript XML), it's required that custom components use an uppercase first letter, such as <code>CustomComponent</code>. This allows React to recognize them as components, unlike native HTML tags like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, which are lowercase.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <strong>The Reason for Capitalization:</strong> If a component is named using lowercase letters (e.g., <code>&lt;customcomponent&gt;</code>), React assumes it is a standard HTML tag, which can lead to unintended behavior when rendering.
    </p>

    <h1>The Purpose of Default Export</h1>
    <p>
        The <code>default</code> keyword in ES6 modules enables you to export a single main value or entity from a file, simplifying module usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        - <strong>What Does Default Export Mean?</strong> Using <code>export default</code> signifies that the module has one primary export. For example, in React, you typically use default export to export a component as the primary entity.
    </p>
    <pre><code>export default CustomComponent;</code></pre>
    <p>
        - <strong>Advantages of Default Export:</strong> Default exports allow you to import the exported entity without needing to use its exact name, offering a cleaner and more flexible import syntax.
    </p>
    <pre><code>import CustomComponent from './CustomComponent';</code></pre>
    <p>
        This approach makes the import process easier, as you don't have to remember the original exported name precisely.
